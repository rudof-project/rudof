For example, `read_data(input, ...)` allows the input to be a URL, a file path or stdin (which can be useful in linux pipes), while `read_data_str(input, ...)` requires the input to be a string.
- Added `read_shapemap(input,...)` which was required by issue #329.

### Fixed
- We found a issue when validating datatype literals because we were not handling

- Merged [srdf_graph](https://crates.io/crates/srdf_graph) and [srdf_sparql](https://crates.io/crates/srdf_sparql) crates into [srdf](https://crates.io/crates/srdf), the former crates will no longer be maintained as their code is integrated in `srdf`.
- Added option `--output` to CLI so the users can choose if the output goes to terminal or to a file
- Changed dependency from [rio_api](https://crates.io/crates/rio) and [rio_turtle](https://crates.io/crates/rio_turtle) to [oxttl](https://crates.io/crates/oxttl) and [oxrdfio](https://crates.io/crates/oxrdfio) which seem to be more actively maintained now.

## [0.0.7] - 2024-01-07

In this release we added support for SHACL by defining the [`shacl_ast`](https://crates.io/crates/shacl_ast) crate.

Other changes:

- Renamed the project from shex_rs to shapes_rs to indicate that the project intends to support both ShEx and SHACL.
- Merged the [srdf_graph](https://crates.io/crates/srdf_graph) and [srdf_sparql](https://crates.io/crates/srdf_sparql) crates into [srdf](https://crates.io/crates/srdf).
- Added more combinators and documentation examples to rdf_parser in order to document the RDF parser combinators approach. See, for example, the doc for the [map method](https://docs.rs/srdf/latest/srdf/srdf_parser/trait.RDFNodeParse.html#method.map).
