This repo contains an RDF data shapes library implemented in Rust.
The implementation supports
[ShEx](http://shex.io/),
[SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/),
[DCTap](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dctap/)
and conversions between different RDF data modeling formalisms.

The code can be used as a Rust library
but it also contains a binary called `rudof`
which can be used as an RDF playground. 

We provide binaries for Linux, Windows, Mac and Docker
(see [releases](https://github.com/rudof-project/rudof/releases)),
as well as Python bindings.

## Features

`rudof` currently supports the following:

- RDF and RDF 1.2 parsing, conversion and visualization.
- SPARQL querying to RDF data and endpoints
- Parsing SPARQL service description
- ShEx
- SHACL
- DCTAP

Future features we are planning to add:

- rdf-config
- LinkML

## Installation

### Official releases

You can download a binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/rudof-project/rudof/releases/latest) page.
There you will also find the compiled packages
for the installation on your system using a package manager.

#### Ubuntu

Download the binary from <https://github.com/rudof-project/rudof/releases>
and install the `.deb` package running the following commands after replacing X.X.X by the latest version:

```sh
wget https://github.com/rudof-project/rudof/releases/download/vX.X.X/rudof_vX.X.X_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i rudof_vX.X.X_amd64.deb
```

#### Windows

The binary can be downloaded from <https://github.com/rudof-project/rudof/releases>.

#### Mac

The binary is available at:
<https://github.com/rudof-project/rudof/releases>
so you can download the corresponding binary to your machine.

The usual way to run/install a binary in Mac is to download it in a folder,
add that folder to your PATH and activating the binary using:

```sh
chmod +x <binary_file>
```

After that, the processor may complain the first time about security
and you have to agree to use it.
Once you agree, it should work.

<summary>Compiling from source</summary>

### Compiling from source

`rudof` has been implemented in Rust
and is compiled using [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).
The command `cargo run` can be used to compile and run locally the code.

For example:

```sh
cargo run -- validate examples/user.ttl --schema examples/user.shex --shapemap examples/user.sm
```
#### Troubleshooting
If the example doesnâ€™t work as expected, here are a few things you can try:
- **Use the --release flag** to compile in release mode, which can resolve some build issues and improve performance:

```sh
cargo run --release -- validate examples/user.ttl --schema examples/user.shex --shapemap examples/user.sm
```

- **Run the command inside WSL** (Windows Subsystem for Linux). If you're using Windows, compiling the project in WSL can help resolve environment-related issues, as Rust tends to compile more reliably and efficiently in Linux-based systems.

### Compiling from source and installing the binary (Debian)

Install `cargo deb` (only the first time)

```sh
cargo install cargo-deb
```

Create the `.deb` package by:

```sh
cargo deb
```

And run:

```sh
sudo dpkg -i target/debian/rudof_0.0.11-1_amd64.deb
```

### Alternative for Linux

To create a binary for Linux with debug information:

```sh
cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

The binary will be created in: `target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/debug/rudof`

If you want a release binary which is more optimized, you can run:

```sh
cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

In this case, the binary will be `target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/rudof`

## Docker

The library is also published as a Docker image
(`angelip2303/rudof:latest`).

## Usage

### Some examples

The folder `examples` contains several example files with ShEx schemas and RDF data.

### Validate a simple RDF file with a ShEx schema using a ShapeMap

```sh
rudof validate examples/user.ttl --schema examples/user.shex --shapemap examples/user.sm
```

We maintain a Wiki page with some common [Usage scenarios and How-to guides](https://github.com/rudof-project/rudof/wiki/Howto-guides).

### Debugging information

It is possible to change the debug level information with:

```sh
export RUST_LOG=value
```

where `value` can be `debug` to show more verbose information or `info` to show basic information.

## Command line usage

```sh
