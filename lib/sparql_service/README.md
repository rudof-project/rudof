# SPARQL Service

This crate contains a SPARQL processor based on [Oxigraph](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph).

As a SPARQL engine/database is already provided by Oxigraph, the intent is simply to provide an API to parse and run SPARQL queries over SPARQL services which can be used by [rudof](https://rudof-project.github.io/rudof/).
