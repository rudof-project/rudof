# This module contains the Python bindings of rudof which are called pyrudof

After compiling and installing this module, a Python library  called `pyrudof` should be available.  

## Build the development version

This module is based on [pyo3](https://pyo3.rs/) and [maturin](https://www.maturin.rs/).

To build and install the development version of `pyrudof` you need to clone this git repository, go to the `python` directory (the one this README is in) and run:

```
pip install maturin
```

followed by:

```sh
pip install .
```
